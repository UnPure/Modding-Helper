# Modding-Helper

Back in the old days while creating maps and mods for old Call of Duty games, i always had the same problem.<br>Too many open folders, too many shortcuts on my desktop or quicklaunch bar for all the folders and programs.<br><br>You always need tons of programs like 3D editors or tools to create/edit images or audio files.<br>You also need tons of folders where all the stuff you need is located.<br><br>I dont like it to have hundreds of shortcuts for every program or folder i need on my desktop or quicklaunch bar.<br>To solve this problem and dont have the same problems on Call of Duty: Black Ops III when the modtools are released,<br>i decided to create a small tool. This is my first project in C# so its definitely not even close to be a perfect tool.<br>However, learning by doing is always the best way!

<br>
**Current Features**:
* Launch Call of Duty: Black Ops III from the Modding-Helper.
* Launch the Black Radiant (Currently only if you have access to the closed alpha).
* Add a button to quickly open programs you regulary need.
* Add a button to quickly open folders you regulary need.
* Add a button to quickly open a website you regulary need in your default browser.
* Decide if you want the Modding-Helper to stay always on top.
* Decide if you want to minimize or close the Modding-Helper to your tray.

<br><br>
**Planed Features:**<br>
Call of Duty: Black Ops III Mod Tools are currently in a closed alpha state.<br>Sadly i dont have access to the tools while they are in closed alpha therefor not all features are implemented now!<br>I'm going to implement more features when the tools hit the open beta stage.<br>Got ideas for more features? Tell me!
